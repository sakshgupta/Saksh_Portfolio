# Next.js Portfolio Website (Client)

Here's the scoop on the client-side of my personal portfolio website: it's built with Next.js, React.js, and Tailwind CSS. It's like the party hat on top of the backend cake!

## Installation

To install the dependencies for the client, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the development server, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

The website can be accessed in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

* Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
* Smooth transitions with Framer Motion

## Folder Structure

The folder is structured as follows:

* `src/components/` contains reusable React components that are used across different pages of the website.
* `src/pages/` directory contains all the pages for the website, with each page represented by a separate `.tsx` file.
* `src/styles/` contains global styles and tailwind configuration.
* `src/utils/` contains various utility functions and modules that can be used throughout the application.
